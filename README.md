# Ruby-Lib-for-Microsoft-Azure-Text-2-Speech
I couldnt find a good library for interfacing with the microsoft azure api, so I made my own, specifically for text to speech.

## Quickstart
replace ```your region here``` with your region lol, then add your api key as an env variable. i dont recommend having it in plaintext in the file. 

please dont use this for anything serious.
